# Lime Tools

This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates a basic user management system and placeholder connections for Hubspot, Linear and Slack.

## Usage

Run the server:

```
node server.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Log in using the default admin credentials:

- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `adminpass`

Admins can manage users and view the connections page. Ordinary users can only see the home page.
